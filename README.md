found this rice on some github/reddit page and stole everything for my use so here it is

wal -i path-to-file | change color theme according to a wallpaper

you need a BetterDiscord to make it work with discord, use pywal-discord or wal-discord for it

nvim for text files
kitty is main terminal
.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc - binds
.config/bspwm/bspwmrc - wm's settings

for spotify there is Spicetify but I didn't managed to make it work at that moment so to make it work there is oomox, I think it will work
