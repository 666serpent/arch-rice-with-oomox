# NOTES:

i stole everything from this:
# https://github.com/donovanglover/dotfiles

wal -i path-to-file | change color theme according to a wallpaper

you need a BetterDiscord to make it work with discord, use pywal-discord or wal-discord for it

nvim for text files

kitty is the main terminal

.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc - binds

.config/bspwm/bspwmrc - wm's settings

for spotify there is Spicetify but I didn't managed to make it work at that moment so to make it work there is oomox and Spicetify themes, I think it will work

Awesome for fonts in polybar and also some of the nerd fonts https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

zsh is the main shell with oh-my-zsh

win's version of dota doesn't work, you need to install it from linux's steam
